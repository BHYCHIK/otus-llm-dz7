Esophagography indicated a main tumor lesion on the left antero-lateral wall and a submucosal tumor on the opposite side, causing esophageal constriction. A CT scan showed a 3 cm protruded tumor lesion without lymph node or distant metastasis. PET-CT scan demonstrated increased FDG uptake in the lower thoracic esophagus but no lymph metastasis. Blood tests for tumor markers (CEA, SCC) were not elevated. Pathological examination confirmed moderately to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, staged as cT2N0M0, cStageII.\\nA: The primary diagnosis is cT2N0M0, cStageII esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, moderately to poorly differentiated. The patient's age and performance status influenced the decision against aggressive preoperative or postoperative therapies.\\nP: The patient underwent thoracoscopy- and laparoscopy-assisted subtotal esophagectomy and reconstruction with a gastric tube, with a total operation time of 377 minutes and minimal blood loss.

    " Doctor: Hello, what brings you in today?\\nPatient: Hi, my 21-month-old son has been experiencing weakness in his lower extremities and lumbar pain after a mild upper respiratory tract infection.\\nDoctor: I see. Did you consult any medical professional for this issue?\\nPatient: Yes, we took him to the pediatric emergency department. They did a hip ultrasound, but they didn't find any joint effusion. They dismissed it as transient hips arthritis and treated him with anti-inflammatory therapy.\\nDoctor: Did the therapy help with his condition?\\nPatient: Unfortunately, no. His pain got worse, and now he's unable to walk. That's why we came back here.\\nDoctor: We should definitely investigate further. We'll start by admitting him to the hospital. We'll need to perform a spine radiograph and an MRI to determine what's causing his condition. \\nPatient: Okay, thank you.\\n[After the tests]\\nDoctor: I've reviewed the test results. The spine radiograph showed a slight reduction in the thickness of the L5 soma. The MRI revealed increased T1 post-enhancement signals in the L4-L5 anulus, the opposite end-plates of L4 and L5, the adjacent soft tissues, and the osteolytic area of the L5 pedicle. These findings suggest that your son has Spondylodiscitis with associated osteomyelitis.\\nPatient: Oh no! What about his blood tests?\\nDoctor: The blood tests showed an increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (77 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (2.17 mg/dL). However, his white blood cell count, procalcitonin serum concentration, and Quantiferon TB-gold test are all within normal ranges. \\nPatient: What's the treatment plan for his condition?\\nDoctor: We'll start him on broad-spectrum intravenous therapy, which includes meropenem (100 mg/kg/day in three doses) and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day in three doses). We'll continue the anti-inflammatory treatment for the first week and then stop it once his symptoms have resolved and he can walk normally again.\\nPatient: How long will the treatment last?\\nDoctor: The treatment may last for a few weeks. We'll closely monitor his progress and adjust the treatment as needed.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you, doctor.\\n[After 3 weeks of therapy]\\nDoctor: I wanted to update you on your son's condition. Unfortunately, he has developed leukopenia with severe neutropenia. His white blood cell count dropped to its lowest at 5410/mm3.\\nPatient: Oh no, is there anything we can do?\\nDoctor: We'll continue to closely monitor his condition and tailor his treatment as necessary. In the meantime, it's important for you to keep an eye on any changes in his symptoms and report them to us immediately. We'll do our best to help him recover.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help. \n",

      "S: The patient, with a history of asthma, was found unresponsive by her husband, who initiated CPR. She reported using a nebulizer prior to the event. The patient was in pulseless electrical activity arrest and received CPR for approximately 10 minutes before EMS arrival. She was given two doses of epinephrine and achieved return of spontaneous circulation. She was hypotensive and had expiratory wheezing upon arrival at the outside hospital.\n",
      "O: At the outside hospital, the patient's blood pressure was 50/41 mmHg, requiring vasopressor support. Initial arterial blood gas showed a pH of <6.8, PaCO2 of 130 mmHg, and PaO2 of 331 mmHg. Continuous albuterol and ventilator adjustments were made. Repeat arterial blood gas showed pH 6.81, PaCO2 138 mmHg, and PaO2 262 mmHg. Upon transfer to our facility, the patient was comatose with fixed, dilated pupils (6 mm, nonreactive), and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3T. CT scan indicated diffuse cerebral edema. Veno-venous ECMO was initiated with specific settings.\n",
      "A: The patient experienced a severe asthma exacerbation leading to a pulseless electrical activity arrest with subsequent severe anoxic brain injury. The primary diagnosis is anoxic brain injury secondary to asthma exacerbation. Differential diagnoses include other causes of coma and elevated intracranial pressure.\n",
      "P: The patient is currently on veno-venous ECMO with continuous monitoring and adjustments as necessary. Mannitol and hypertonic saline were administered for cerebral edema without noted improvement in neurological status. The neurologic intensive care unit is involved in her care, focusing on optimizing neurological outcomes. Family has been updated on her condition and treatment plan. Further interventions will be guided by her response to current therapies and ongoing assessments.\n",
