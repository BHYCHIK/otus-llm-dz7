    " Doctor: Hello, what brings you in today?\\nPatient: Hi, my 21-month-old son has been experiencing weakness in his lower extremities and lumbar pain after a mild upper respiratory tract infection.\\nDoctor: I see. Did you consult any medical professional for this issue?\\nPatient: Yes, we took him to the pediatric emergency department. They did a hip ultrasound, but they didn't find any joint effusion. They dismissed it as transient hips arthritis and treated him with anti-inflammatory therapy.\\nDoctor: Did the therapy help with his condition?\\nPatient: Unfortunately, no. His pain got worse, and now he's unable to walk. That's why we came back here.\\nDoctor: We should definitely investigate further. We'll start by admitting him to the hospital. We'll need to perform a spine radiograph and an MRI to determine what's causing his condition. \\nPatient: Okay, thank you.\\n[After the tests]\\nDoctor: I've reviewed the test results. The spine radiograph showed a slight reduction in the thickness of the L5 soma. The MRI revealed increased T1 post-enhancement signals in the L4-L5 anulus, the opposite end-plates of L4 and L5, the adjacent soft tissues, and the osteolytic area of the L5 pedicle. These findings suggest that your son has Spondylodiscitis with associated osteomyelitis.\\nPatient: Oh no! What about his blood tests?\\nDoctor: The blood tests showed an increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (77 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (2.17 mg/dL). However, his white blood cell count, procalcitonin serum concentration, and Quantiferon TB-gold test are all within normal ranges. \\nPatient: What's the treatment plan for his condition?\\nDoctor: We'll start him on broad-spectrum intravenous therapy, which includes meropenem (100 mg/kg/day in three doses) and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day in three doses). We'll continue the anti-inflammatory treatment for the first week and then stop it once his symptoms have resolved and he can walk normally again.\\nPatient: How long will the treatment last?\\nDoctor: The treatment may last for a few weeks. We'll closely monitor his progress and adjust the treatment as needed.\\nPatient: Alright, thank you, doctor.\\n[After 3 weeks of therapy]\\nDoctor: I wanted to update you on your son's condition. Unfortunately, he has developed leukopenia with severe neutropenia. His white blood cell count dropped to its lowest at 5410/mm3.\\nPatient: Oh no, is there anything we can do?\\nDoctor: We'll continue to closely monitor his condition and tailor his treatment as necessary. In the meantime, it's important for you to keep an eye on any changes in his symptoms and report them to us immediately. We'll do our best to help him recover.\\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. We appreciate your help. \n",

      "S: The patient, a 21-month-old male, presented with weakness in his lower extremities and lumbar pain following a mild upper respiratory tract infection. Initial treatment with anti-inflammatory therapy for suspected transient hips arthritis was ineffective, leading to worsening pain and inability to walk.\n",
      "O: Hip ultrasound showed no joint effusion. Spine radiograph revealed slight reduction in the thickness of the L5 soma. MRI indicated increased T1 post-enhancement signals in the L4-L5 anulus, opposite end-plates of L4 and L5, adjacent soft tissues, and osteolytic area of the L5 pedicle. Blood tests showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (77 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (2.17 mg/dL), with normal white blood cell count, procalcitonin serum concentration, and Quantiferon TB-gold test. After 3 weeks of therapy, the patient developed leukopenia with severe neutropenia (white blood cell count at 5410/mm3).\n",
      "A: Primary diagnosis is Spondylodiscitis with associated osteomyelitis. Differential diagnosis initially included transient hips arthritis. Complications include leukopenia with severe neutropenia.\n",
      "P: Initiated broad-spectrum intravenous therapy with meropenem (100 mg/kg/day in three doses) and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day in three doses), alongside continuation of anti-inflammatory treatment for the first week. Plan to closely monitor the patient's progress and adjust treatment as necessary, with specific attention to the recent development of leukopenia with severe neutropenia. Regular follow-ups and blood tests are scheduled to monitor the condition and treatment efficacy.\n",
